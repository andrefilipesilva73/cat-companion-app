# CatCompanionApp
CatCompanionApp üòº is a Kotlin-based Android application built with Jetpack Compose, following the MVVM architecture. It utilizes the Cat API to provide users with a delightful experience exploring various cat breeds. The app features a clean and intuitive UI, allowing users to view cat images, search for breeds, mark favorites, and learn more about each breed's details. With offline functionality, error handling, and unit testing, CatCompanionApp is designed for both cat enthusiasts and developers seeking a well-structured Android app example.

The main purpose of this project is to develop my Android development skills, as well as to showcase my software architecture, planning and project execution skills.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I'm not an Android developer and my knowledge of Android is limited to managing development teams. This is an opportunity to deepen my knowledge in this area, as well as to effectively update myself on the latest technologies available and the current state of Android development.
